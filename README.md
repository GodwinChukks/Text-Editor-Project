## LINUX TEXT EDITORS

## Linux text editors are tools used to create and modify text files, including configuration files, scripts, code, and notes. They are essential for system administration, programming, and general file editing. In this project we are going to explore two most popular text editors which are vim and nano.

## vim TEXT EDITOR

## vim (Vi IMproved) is a highly efficient and powerful text editor used in the Linux terminal. It's an enhanced version of the classic vi editor, designed for programmers and power users who need speed, flexibility, and extensive editing capabilities.

## Key Features:
- Modal editing – Operates in different modes:

- Normal mode (navigation/commands)

- Insert mode (typing text)

- Visual mode (selecting text)

- Command-line mode (saving, searching, quitting, etc.)

- Syntax highlighting, auto-completion, search and replace, macros, and plugins.

- Very lightweight and available by default on most Linux systems.

## Basic Commands:

- Press i → to enter Insert mode

- Type your text
Press Esc → to return to Normal mode

- Type :w → to save, :q → to quit, or :wq → to save and quit

## SUMMARY
